## Description
In this assignment I tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Notes
1. This assignment allows you to POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE
2. A wonderful way to learn ORM
3. I have also attached a screenshot of how my insomnia application was structred
4. Thank You.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

```
## Installation
The Technology/engine required to run this application/assignment was Sequelize.

This is what my Insomia Application looked like once the assignment was complete.
